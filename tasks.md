take height map, and exxtract features at various altitudes, display in 3d or 2d at set altitude

ol  pejata and fuego are good examples

todo:

sensitivity plots -> find cut off points on UAV configurations
how does weight batttery etc. affect config and end rseult on flight time

For next meeting:
write about bigger picture, where we are going -> developing two or more tools, looking at ridge lift and solar forecaster with respect to varying aircraft configuration/mission plan, can we find the limits?
Write the pseudocode properly
make the output algorithm. reference any source numbers


refertence the shit out of it.
