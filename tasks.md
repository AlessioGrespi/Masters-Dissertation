take height map, and exxtract features at various altitudes, display in 3d or 2d at set altitude

ol  pejata and fuego are good examples

todo:

sensitivity plots -> find cut off points on UAV configurations
how does weight batttery etc. affect config and end rseult on flight time
different latitudes and time of year

Algortihms:

Title more accurate
Make tasks more concise and better name

rewrite latex
write the current availabe power for a planar aircraft

start writing some diss stuff

For next meeting:
write about bigger picture, where we are going -> developing two or more tools, looking at ridge lift and solar forecaster with respect to varying aircraft configuration/mission plan, can we find the limits?
Write the pseudocode properly
make the output algorithm. reference any source numbers


refertence the shit out of it.

---------------------------

ratio between payload, airframe, fuel weight etc
Use this information to then work backwards
look at lift to drag ratios 30-40:1


sensitivity plot: 
- payload (ratio) -> weight(mass), aircraft efficiency payload vs overall mass(airframe + fuel)
- lift:drag -> cross sectional area, lifting area
- Solar energy per unit mass aircraft
- airspeed vs drag DONE!

This week:

- Find a height map and see i can run filter thru it, check bristol and gloustershire gliding club maybe
- Do the heron stuff from tom email
- start playing with sensitivity plots
- find references for values i.e. solar cells etc. 
- look at glider and maybe other airframes?
- sensitivty plot of heading vs sun for z wing
